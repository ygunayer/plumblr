# plumblr
A command-line utility that allows you to bulk-download all media from a given tumblr blog.

Totally not a *"rewrite"* of [https://github.com/ygunayer/trustlr](ygunayer/trustlr) since it's technically not completed.

## Usage
The tool is still in WIP phase so it doesn't actually work. But when it does, use it like this:

```
$ plumblr (blog-name)
```
